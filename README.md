# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this Project I applied Logistic Regression model for breast cancer survivability on two parameters: Benign and Malignant Cancer patients. I applied Data Selection, Preprocessing and Evaluation to develop the prediction model. In this project I used Binary Categorical survival variable, which was calculated from the variable in the raw dataset to represent survivability where Malignant is represented with value ‘0’ and Benign is represented with value ‘1’.
